<note><para>Before we discuss the options that follow, it is important to understand that there are two 
ways that personal computers can play a &CD;.</para>

<para>The first method (which &kscd; refers to as direct digital playback), is performed by reading the digital data from the 
&CD; using Digital Audio Extraction (DAE).  This data is sent to your machines CPU which converts the digital data to sound.  This method requires 
a &CD; drive that is capable of DAE (most new drives are) and it requires some CPU processing time to generate the sounds you hear.</para>

<para>The second method uses the internal circuitry available on most &CD; drives to read the data and generate the sounds you will hear 
without using your computers CPU.  This data is transmitted by a dedicated cable directly to the sound card in your computer.  This method requires 
less CPU proccessing time, but it does require that the dedicated cable be connected inside your computer.  Not all computers have this connection.</para></note>

<para>The check box labeled <guilabel>Use direct digital playback</guilabel> determines which method &kscd; uses to read the audio tracts.  If there is a mark in the check box, the first method is used.  If there is no mark in the check box, the second method is utilized.</para>

<para>If you have selected direct digital playback, a drop down box labeled <guilabel>Select audio backend</guilabel> will let you select which 
sound backend the digital information should be sent to.  The contents of the drop down box will vary depending on your system. 
Most users should select <guilabel>phonon</guilabel>.  You can also select the device the audio backend uses by entering the device location in 
the text box labeled <guilabel>Select audio device</guilabel>.  A full discussion of audio devices and audio backends is beyond the scope of this manual.</para>

<para>If a mark is placed in the check box labeled <guilabel>Allow encoding selection</guilabel>, you can select the text encoding for the results of a CDDB request.</para>
<tip><para>The standard describes CDDB results as being strictly Latin 1.  If you are not having problems with your CDDB information, leave this box unchecked.</para></tip>

<para>When preparing entries for the <acronym>CDDB</acronym>, please keep the
following points in mind:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Use <quote>standard</quote> latin characters in the entries. Some
special characters are supported, but Cyrillic or Greek alphabet submissions,
for example, cannot be accepted.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Use only one <keysym>/</keysym> character in the
<guilabel>Disc Artist / Title</guilabel> field in the &CD; Database

<title>Determining if the mixer volume levels are up</title>
<para>The next step is to determine if &kmix; volume levels are appropriate.</para>
<note><para>&kmix; is a sound mixer panel that is included in &kde;.  This mixer allows you to adjust the relative volume levels of many sound components.</para></note>
<para>To start &kmix;, select 
<menuchoice><guimenu>Applications</guimenu><guisubmenu>Multimedia</guisubmenu>
<guimenuitem>Sound Mixer &kmix;</guimenuitem></menuchoice> in the &kmenu;.</para>
<para>Click with the &LMB; on the &kmix; icon in the panel and choose <guilabel>Mixer</guilabel> to display a new window with a number of volume sliders.  Depending on the configuration, the sliders may have labels, or the labels may be hidden.  If you do not see any labels for the sliders, you should make the labels visible before continuing.  To make the labels visible, select 
<menuchoice><guimenu>Settings</guimenu><guimenuitem>Configure &kmix;...</guimenuitem></menuchoice> from the &kmix; window.  This will open a small window with a few check boxes. To 
turn the labels on, place a mark in the check box labeled <guilabel>Show labels</guilabel> and click <guibutton>OK</guibutton>.</para>
<para>Each slider controls the volume of a different audio device.  There are two parts to each device that may need to be altered.  If you look at a slider, there is a small check box above each slider labelled <guilabel>Mute</guilabel>.  If you click on this checkbox you can mute the audio device and it will not produce any sound.  Once you have verified that the device is not muted, you increase the volume of the device by draging the bar up the slider.  The volume of an audio device is decreased by dragging the bar down the slider.</para>
<para>Click on the tab labeled <guilabel>Output</guilabel>.</para>
<para>Please make sure the sliders are not muted and that the bar is all the way at the top of the slider for the following audio devices:</para>

<para>If you still do not hear the &CD;, click on the tab labeled <guilabel>Input</guilabel></para>
<para>Now make sure the slider labeled <guilabel>CD</guilabel> is not muted and that the bar is all the way at the top of the slider.</para>
<para>If you can hear the &CD; now, you can stop troubleshooting.  If not, click <link linkend="ts-othersounds">here</link> to continue</para>

<title>Determine if other sounds are audible on my computer</title>
<para>In this section, we are going to test to see if other types of sounds are audible on your computer. We will do this by playing a sound over the speakers that is stored on your hard drive.  </para>
<para>First we must locate an appropriate test file.  This will be done using the command line.</para>
<para>Select <menuchoice><guimenuitem>Applications</guimenuitem><guimenuitem>System</guimenuitem>
<guimenuitem>Terminal &konsole;</guimenuitem></menuchoice> in the &kmenu;. A new window will appear with a command prompt.  At the prompt type:</para>
<para><screen><prompt>$</prompt> <userinput><command>locate -n1 KDE_Window_Open.wav</command></userinput></screen></para>
<para>When you press return, there will be a pause, and a single line with a file location will be printed below your typed command.</para>
<para><screen><prompt>$</prompt> <userinput><command>locate -n1 KDE_Window_Open.wav</command></userinput>
/usr/local/kde/share/sounds/KDE_Window_Open.wav</screen></para>

<para>Now you are going to ask &kde; to play this short sound file. Type the text <command>noatun</command> followed by a space. Then copy the full location of the file you just located with the previous command.  For example: </para>
<para><screen><prompt>$</prompt> <userinput><command>noatun /usr/local/kde/share/sounds/KDE_Window_Open.wav</command></userinput></screen></para>
<para>If you heard a short sound, <link linkend="ts-othersoundsplay">click here</link>.</para>
<para>If you did not hear a short sound, your sound system is not configured correctly.  Click <link linkend="ts-noothersounds">here</link> to proceed.</para>

<sect1 id="ts-noothersounds">
<title>The test sound failed to play</title>
<para>So far, we have verified that the volume on &kscd; and all the mixer levels in &kmix; are set correctly.  We have also sent a test sound and you could not hear the sound played.  This suggests the trouble is not with &kscd; but rather with your sound configuration.</para>
<note><para>Please make sure the &CD; is still playing in your &CD; drive.</para></note>
<para>First, we need to make sure your speakers are plugged in and that the volume of your speakers is set appropriately.  If you are using external speakers, please check the following:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Please make sure the speakers are connected to your computer appropriatly (see your user manual if necessary).</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>If your speakers require batteries, please replace the batteries with fresh batteries.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>If your external speakers plug into the wall, please make sure they are plugged in to the socket, the power cord is securely plugged into the back of the speakers and the wall outlet is working.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>If your speakers have a power button, please make sure the power is turned on.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>If your speakers have a volume knob, please make sure the volume is turned half way between off and maximum.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>If your speakers are part of you computers case, please check to see if your speakers have a volume knob. If they do make sure the volume is turned half way between off and maximum.</para>

<para>If you have checked all of this, you probably need detailed help on getting the sound working on your computer.

<title>The test sound played, but I cannot hear the &CD;</title>
<para>So far, we have verified that the volume on &kscd; and all the mixer levels in &kmix; are set correctly.  We have also played a test sound and you were able to  hear the sound played.  This suggests the trouble is limited to &kscd; or the &CD;.</para>
<para>Check to make sure the &CD; is playable.  If this is a new &CD;, put it in another &CD; player (preferrably not located in a computer) and make sure the &CD; is playable in that device.  If it is playable in another device, continue <link linkend="ts-ddpback">here</link>.</para>

<title>Try using direct digital playback</title>
<para>There are two 
ways that personal computers can play a &CD;.</para>

<para>The first method (which &kscd; refers to as direct digital playback), is performed by reading the digital data from the 
&CD; using Digital Audio Extraction (DAE).  This data is sent to your machines CPU which converts the digital data to sound.  This method requires 
a &CD; drive that is capable of DAE (most new drives are) and it requires some CPU processing time to generate the sounds you hear.</para>

<para>The second method uses the internal circuitry available on many &CD; drives to read the data and generate the sounds you will hear 
without using your computers CPU.  This data is transmitted by a dedicated cable directly to the sound card in your computer.  This method requires 
less CPU proccessing time, but it does require that the dedicated cable be connected inside your computer.  Not all computers have this connection.</para>

<para>&kscd; defaults to the second method of playback.  The next step in troubleshooting your &CD; problems is to enable direct digital playback. To do this begin by clicking on the button labeled <guibutton>Stop</guibutton> on the &kscd; window. This will stop any attempt to play the &CD; for now.</para>

<para>Now click on the button labeled <guibutton>Extras</guibutton>.  This will open a small menu.  Select <guilabel>Configure &kscd;...</guilabel>.  This will open a new dialog box.</para>
<para>Click the icon labeled <guilabel>CD Player</guilabel> on the left side of the dialog box.</para>
<para>Place a mark in the check box labeled <guilabel>Use direct digital playback</guilabel>.</para>
<para>Click <guibutton>OK</guibutton>.  </para>
<para>Now click <guibutton>Play</guibutton> in the &kscd; window and see if the &CD; begins to play correctly.</para>

<para>If you still cannot hear the music on the &CD;, your problem requires specific knowledge of your system and the problems you encounter.  The reader is referred to many good Internet resources for this information.  Please consider finding help in one of the following ways:</para>

<answer><para>This means that &kscd; couldn't open your &CD-ROM; drive. The name of
the device in the <guilabel>&CD-ROM; Device</guilabel> field of the
<guilabel>Kscd Configuration</guilabel> must actually refer to the block device
associated with your &CD-ROM; drive. This will often be a hardlink to the
appropriate <acronym>IDE</acronym> (<filename>/dev/hdx</filename>) or
<acronym>SCSI</acronym> (<filename>/dev/sdx</filename>) device.</para>

<para> The device file normally belongs to user root in group root, and does not
allow normal users to open it for reading, writing, or execution directly. This
has <emphasis>nothing</emphasis> to do with the <application>SUID</application>
(Set User <acronym>ID</acronym> programs use the <function>setuid()</function>
function in the standard Un*x library to assume the identity of another user)
<command>mount</command> command, which has no problems with permissions; &kscd;
must be able to get a read-only file descriptor referring to the &CD; device to
control the &CD-ROM; drive and read raw data off the disk.</para>

<para> If you have the root password, you can fix this quickly and easily.
Become root and type <userinput><command>chmod</command> <option>a+r</option>
<filename><replaceable>/dev/cdrom</replaceable></filename></userinput> to allow
any user on your system to read from <filename>/dev/cdrom</filename>.  If your
&CD-ROM; device is called something else, change the permissions on that device
with the same procedure. If you don't have the root password, ask your system
administrator nicely to give you read permission for the &CD-ROM; device.</para>
