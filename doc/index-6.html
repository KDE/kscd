<LI>Q. I see this dialog when I start <B>kscd</B>. What's wrong?

<P>
<IMG SRC="kscd16.gif">
<P>A. This means that <B>kscd</B> couldn't open your CDROM drive. The name of the device
in the &quot;CDROM Device&quot; field of the &quot;<B>kscd</B> Configuration&quot; must
actually refer to the block device associated with your CD-ROM drive. This will often
be a hardlink to the appropriate IDE (<B>/dev/hd<EM>x</EM></B>) or SCSI
(<B>/dev/sd<EM>x</EM></B>) device. The device file normally belongs to
user <B>root</B> in group <B>root</B>, and does not allow normal users to
open it for reading, writing, or execution directly. This has *nothing* to
do with the SUID <EM>(Set User ID programs use the <B>setuid()</B> function in the standard Un*x
library to assume the identity of another user)</EM> 
<B>mount</B> command, which has no problems with permissions; <B>kscd</B> must be able to get a
read-only file descriptor referring to the CD device to control the CDROM drive 
and read raw data off the disk.
<P>
<P>If you have the root password, you can fix this quickly and easily.
Become root and type <B>chmod a+r /dev/cdrom</B> to allow any user on your
system to read from <B>/dev/cdrom</B>. If your CDROM device is called
something else, change the permissions on that device with the same
procedure. If you don't have the root password, ask your system 
administrator nicely to give you read permission for the CDROM device.

<LI>Q. I can't get the CDDB to work.
Can I get any detailed information about what may be going wrong?

<P>A. If you experience trouble with the CDDB functionality try to starting
<B>kscd</B> from the command line with the <CODE>-d</CODE> switch and observe the 
debug output.
