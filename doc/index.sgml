<p>
<sect>Installation
<p>
<sect1>How to obtain <bf/kscd/
<p>
Kscd is part of the kdemultimedia package available at 
KDE project <url url="http://www.kde.org">.

<sect1>Requirements
<p>
In order to successfully compile Kscd, you need the latest versions
of the KDE libraries as well as the Qt C++ library. All required libraries as well as Kscd 
itself can be found on <url url="ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/">. 

<sect1>Compilation and installation
<p>

In order to compile and install Kscd on your system, type the following in the base 
directory of the Kscd distribution:
<tscreen><verb>
% ./configure
% make
% make install
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
Please inform me of any modification you had to undertake in order to
get KSCD to compile on your platform.
<p>

<sect>Onscreen Fundamentals
<p>

<sect1>Basic operation

<img src="kscd1.gif">

<p>This is the main window of kscd. You should see something like this
when you start <bf/kscd/. The controls in this window are explained below,
in no particular order.

<img src="kscd2.gif">

<p>This is the main control panel for <bf/kscd/. The function of these buttons 
should be familiar to anyone who has ever used a CD player. The uppermost 
button in the above diagram toggles between playing and pausing the CD. The left 
button in the second row stops playing the CD. The right button in the second row 
toggles looping, so that the CD will start playing again from the beginning when the 
end of the last audio track is reached. The buttons in the third row advance 
the CD backward <em/(left)/ or forward <em/(right)/ 30 seconds. The buttons
in the fourth row skip forward <em/(right)/ or backward <em/(left)/ to the
beginning of the next or previous track.

<img src="kscd2a.gif">

<p>This button ejects the CD. Note that the eject button on your CD-ROM drive 
may not respond if an audio CD is in the drive and <bf/kscd/ is started. Some 
very old CD-ROM drives may not support software eject. You may also have to close 
the CD-ROM drive manually after inserting a new disc.

<img src="kscd3.gif">

<p>This is the status display. Starting at the top, from right to left, is the
main time display <em>(See below for a discussion of the various possible time 
display modes)</em>, the status of the CD-ROM drive, the total play time of the
audio CD, the current volume setting, and the current and maximum track 
numbers (<em/curr./ / <em/max./). The bottommost two lines of text display 
the artist and title of the CD, and then the title of the track, assuming that
appropriate entries exist in the local or network CDDB <em/(CD Data Base)/.

<p>
<img src="kscd4.gif">

<p>This button toggles between the possible main time display modes. By default, 
<bf/kscd/ displays the elapsed time of the current track, if the CD is 
playing, or either --:-- or 00:00 if the CD is not playing. Pressing this button 
toggles in sequence between remaining track time, total elapsed time, and total 
remaining time.

<img src="kscd5.gif">

<p>This button opens the <bf/kscd/ configuration panel. This allows you
to configure <bf/kscd/ to work on your machine. See <ref id="configure" name="Configuring kscd">
for details about configuring <bf/kscd/. 

<img src="kscd6.gif">

<p>This button opens the CDDB <em/(Compact Disc Data Base)/ entry editor
panel. The CDDB can identify your CD and often download a list of tracks for
that CD or load it from the filesystem. See <ref id="editor" name="The CD Database Editor"> for details
about using this tool.

<img src="kscd7.gif"><label id="information">

<p>This button will help you search for information about the artist on the
Internet. You can find out about performance dates, purchase information,
and other information by pressing this button and choosing the appropriate
option in the pop-up menu that appears.

<img src="kscd9.gif">

<p>This button closes <bf/kscd/.

<img src="kscd10.gif">

<p>This slider controls the volume of the audio output of the CD. Right is
louder, left is quieter. If you are playing your CD through your sound card, 
the sound card mixer will affect the playback volume as well.

<img src="kscd11.gif">

<p>This combo box lets you directly select a track to play.

<img src="kscd15.gif">

<p>This button plays the CD tracks in random order.

<sect1>Configuring <bf/kscd/ <label id="configure">

<p>The primary configuration window for <bf/kscd/ is a tabbed dialog with three 
major sections.

<itemize>
<item><ref id="cddb" name="CDDB">
<item><ref id="options" name="Kscd Options">
<item><ref id="about" name="About">
</itemize>

<sect2>The CDDB tab <label id="cddb">

<img src="kscd13.gif">

<p>The CDDB tab sets up the <ref id="database" name="CDDB">
<em/(Compact Disc Data Base)/ functions of <em/kscd/.
The &quot;Enable Remote CDDB&quot; checkbox turns on or off CDDB lookups over the Internet.

<p>The &quot;CDDB Base Directory"&quot; text field lets you choose the
directory where you want CDDB entries to be stored locally.

<p>The &quot;Send CDDB submissions to:&quot; field contains the e-mail 
address to submit CDDB entries to. The default address is
&quot;xmcd-cddb@amb.org&quot;. As of version 8.0, CDDB entries from kscd are
accepted for inclusion in the database.

<p>The &quot;CDDB Server&quot; list box shows a list of known CDDB servers.
Select an entry from this list and it will appear in the text field above the
selection box. Press the &quot;Update&quot; button to update the list of
servers in the list box. Press the &quot;Defaultsquot; button to enter the
default value, &quot;cddb.cddb.com 888&quot;, which will permit you to update
the list with a fresh list of CDDB Servers listed with the master CDDB site at
cddb.cddb.com. 

<p>The &quot;Help&quot; button opens the <bf/kscd/ help home page.

<sect2>The Kscd Options tab <label id="options">

<img src="kscd14.gif">

<p>The &quot;LED Color:&quot; and &quot;Background Color:&quot; fields show the
color selected for the foreground and background of the status display. Press
the &quot;Change&quot; button next to the color box to change these colors.

<p>The &quot;CDROM Device&quot; field contains the name of the CDROM device to
be used to play audio CDs. The default value is &quot;/dev/cdrom&quot;. The
permissions on this device <em/must/ be set to allow opening this device
read-only. Changing the permissions on this device file will in almost all
cases require superuser priveleges and can be done from the command line or in
the &quot;Super User Mode&quot; of <bf/kfm/.

<p>The &quot;Unix mail command&quot; field shows the command used to send new CDDB entries to the
database.  The default value is &quot;mail -s &quot;%s&quot;&quot;. You will
need to make sure this command will actually send mail to non-local systems if
you want to submit CDDB entries, especially if you access the Internet through
a dial-up connection. Check the documentation for your Linux distribution for
details. Some Linux distributions that use <bf/sendmail/ to deliver e-mail
require only that you enter your mail host into the &quot;&quot;Smart&quot;
relay host&quot; field in <bf>/etc/sendmail.cf</bf>. In addition, the CDDB site
will want to be able to mail you back; it may therefore also be neccessary to
edit <bf>/etc/sendmail.cf</bf> to ensure that the return address on the
submission is valid. Your mileage is likely to vary.

<p>The &quot;WWW-Browser&quot; section lets you choose which web browser to use
 to access the web sites in the <ref id="information" name="information button">
menus. You can choose either
<bf/kfm/ or a custom browser with the radio buttons. By default, the
&quot;Use Custom Browser&quot; field contains
&quot;netscape &quot;%s&quot;&quot;, for use with Netscape Navigator or
Communicator.

<p>The &quot;Show Tool Tips&quot; checkbox turns tooltips <em>(tiny windows that
pop up when the mouse is &quot;parked&quot; briefly over a control)</em> on or
off.

<p>The &quot;Help&quot; button opens the <bf/kscd/ help home page.

<sect2>The About tab <label id="about">

<p>The &quot;About&quot; tab displays information about the version of <bf/kscd/ you are using
and some copyright information.

<sect1>The CD Database Editor <label id="editor">

<img src="kscd8.gif" height=488>

<p>The CD Database Editor allows you to modify, download, save, annotate, and
upload <ref id="database" name="CDDB"> <em/(Compact Disc Data Base)/ entries.
If there is an entry in your local CDDB tree <em>(see the <ref id="cddb" name="CDDB Tab"> in
the <bf/kscd/ configuration window)</em> for the CD in the in your CD-ROM drive, or if the disc could be
found in the CDDB, you will see the name of the artist and the title of the CD
in the &quot;Disc Artist / Title&quot; field and a list of tracks with song
titles in the &quot;Track / Time / Title &quot; selection box. Otherwise, you
will see a list of tracks and play times without titles. 

<p>You can make an annotation for the entire disc with the &quot;Ext Info&quot;
button next to the &quot;Disc Artist / Title&quot; field, or for a selected
track in the &quot;Track / Time /Title&quot; selection box with the adjacent
&quot;Ext Info&quot; button.

<p>If you select a track in the &quot;Track / Time
/Title&quot; selection box, the title, if present, will appear in the
&quot;Edit Track Title&quot; field below. You can type a title for the track in
the box, or edit the entry to suit your needs. Press the &quot;Return&quot; key
on your keyboard, and the text will appear in the proper line in the selection
box. 

<p>Once all tracks have been given titles and the &quot;Disc Artist /
Title&quot; field has been filled out, you can press the &quot;Submit&quot;
 button to send your submission by e-mail to the CDDB. You will be prompted to
select a category for the submission.

<p>The &quot;Disc ID&quot; section displays the
32 bit ID code used by the CDDB to identify a compact disc. Above the ID code
is the category of the CDDB entry. These categories correspond to the
subdirectories tree of the directory chosen in the &quot;CDDB Base
Directory&quot; in the <ref id="cddb" name="CDDB tab"> of the <bf/kscd/ Configuration window.

<p>The &quot;Total Time:&quot; display shows the total play time of the CD.

<p>The &quot;Play List Editor&quot; lets you change the play order of a 
disc. Enter a comma seperated list of track numbers to define a new play order.

<p>The &quot;Save&quot; button writes the displayed record to disk. You will be
prompted to select a category under which to save the record. Select a
directory and press &quot;Ok&quot; to finish saving.

<p>The &quot;Load&quot; button will prompt you for a location to look for a
CDDB entry other than a remote CDDB server or the local CDDB entries in the
file system.

<p>The &quot;Close&quot; button closes the CD Database Editor.

<sect>CDDB Support <label id="database">

<p>The Compact Disc Data Base is a distributed network database accessible over
the Internet that contains information about most audio CDs in circulation. If
you have Internet access, you will likely never have to manually enter track
information for your CDs if you have this set up properly. See the
<ref id="cddb" name="the CDDB tab"> of the Configuration window
for detailed instructions on how to configure
this service, and <ref id="editor" name="The CD Database Editor">
for instructions on how to edit CDDB entries.

<p>Use of the CDDB is free. Submissions from users are encouraged.  

<p>When preparing entries for the CDDB, please keep the following points in
mind: 
<itemize>
<item>Use &quot;standard&quot; latin characters in the entries. Some
special characters are supported, but Cyrillic or Greek alphabet submissions,
for example, cannot be accepted.
<item> Use only one &quot;/&quot; character in the &quot;Disc Artist /
Title&quot; field in the &quot;CD Database Editor&quot;. For classical CDs, it
is standard practice to put the composer's name in the Artist section 
<em/(before the slash)/ and the performer's name in the Title section
<em/(after the slash)/.
<item>If you send an entry that already exists in the database, any additional
information you provide may be added to the existing entry.
</itemize>

<p>By default, <bf/kscd/ installs the standard CDDB
categories in <bf>$KDEDIR/share/apps/kscd/cddb</bf>. You can create as many
category  subdirectories as you like. However,when uploading only the offical
CDDB  categories are displayed. The default upload address is
&quot;xmcd-cddb@amb.org&quot;. For more information about CDDB visit the CDDB
<htmlurl url="http://www.cddb.com" name="homepage">.

<p>The local CDDB entry for a
particular CD is stored in the file <bf><em>&lt;category name&gt;/&lt;disc
ID&gt;</em></bf> under the &quot;CDDB Base Directory&quot;. These files can be
edited with any text editor if you have nothing better to do with your spare
time.

<sect>Questions and answers

<p>
<itemize>
<item>Q. I see this dialog when I start <bf/kscd/. What's wrong?

<img src="kscd16.gif">

<p>
A. This means that <bf/kscd/ couldn't open your CDROM drive. The name of the device
in the &quot;CDROM Device&quot; field of the &quot;<bf/kscd/ Configuration&quot; must
actually refer to the block device associated with your CD-ROM drive. This will often
be a hardlink to the appropriate IDE (<bf>/dev/hd<em>x</em></bf>) or SCSI
(<bf>/dev/sd<em>x</em></bf>) device. The device file normally belongs to
user <bf/root/ in group <bf/root/, and does not allow normal users to
open it for reading, writing, or execution directly. This has *nothing* to
do with the SUID <em>(Set User ID programs use the <bf>setuid()</bf> function in the standard Un*x
library to assume the identity of another user)</em> 
<bf/mount/ command, which has no problems with permissions; <bf/kscd/ must be able to get a
read-only file descriptor referring to the CD device to control the CDROM drive 
and read raw data off the disk.

<p>If you have the root password, you can fix this quickly and easily.
Become root and type <bf>chmod a+r /dev/cdrom</bf> to allow any user on your
system to read from <bf>/dev/cdrom</bf>. If your CDROM device is called
something else, change the permissions on that device with the same
procedure. If you don't have the root password, ask your system 
administrator nicely to give you read permission for the CDROM device.

<p>See also section <ref id="configure" name="Configuring kscd">.

<p>

<item>
Q. I can't get the CDDB to work.
Can I get any detailed information about what may be going wrong?

<p>
A. If you experience trouble with the CDDB functionality try to starting
<bf/kscd/ from the command line with the <tt>-d</tt> switch and observe the 
debug output.
